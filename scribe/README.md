# STA 380 (Part 2): Scribe Notes

"When am I scribing?  Who else is scribing on my day?"  [The schedule is here.](when_am_I_scribing.pdf)  

Scribe notes will be posted here as they arrive.  Remember, please e-mail a link to the PDF (or .md) file that you've posted on your own GitHub page.  (This is a lot easier for me than if I receive a bunch of attachments.)
