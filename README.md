# STA380: Predictive Modeling

Welcome to Part 2 of STA 380: Predictive Modeling.  All course materials can be found through this GitHub page, including the [course syllabus](syllabus.md).  

## Topics 

### (1) The data scientist's toolbox

Good data and analysis practices; R; Markdown and RMarkdown; version control with Git and Github.

Readings:  
- [Jeff Leek's guide to sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)  
- [Introduction to RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)    


### (2) Exploratory analysis

Contingency tables; basic plots (scatterplot, boxplot, histogram); lattice plots; QQ plots; correlation and rank correlation; heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.  

Readings:  
- NIST Handbook, Chapter 1.  
- R walkthroughs on basic EDA: [contingency tables](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic.html), [histograms](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/citytemps/citytemps.html), and [scatterplots/lattice plots](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/sat/sat.html).   


### (3) Resampling methods

The bootstrap and the permutation test.

Readings:  
- [These notes](http://jgscott.github.io/SDS325H_Spring2015/files/05-QuantifyingUncertaintyPart1.pdf), pages 99-111.  This is an introduction to the bootstrap from the perspective of linear regression modeling, but it conveys the essential idea.  
- [This R walkthrough](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.html) on using the bootstrap to estimate the variability of a sample mean.  
- [Another R walkthrough](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic_permtest.html) on the permutation test in a simple 2x2 table.  



### (4) Finding latent classes

K-means clustering; mixture models; hierarchical clustering.  Reading: ISL Section 10.1 and 10.3.


### (5) Finding latent features

Principal component analysis (PCA); factor analysis; canonical correlation analysis; multi-dimensional scaling.

Readings:  
- ISL Section 10.2.  


### (6) Text data

Co-occurrence statistics; TF-IDF; topic models; vector-space models of text (if time allows).


### (7) Miscellaneous

Coverage of these topics will depend on the time available.  Possibilities include: anomaly detection; label propagation; learning association rules; graph partitioning; partial least squares.
